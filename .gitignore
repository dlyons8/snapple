# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/snapple-backend/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/snapple-backend/log/*
/snapple-backend/tmp/*
!/snapple-backend/log/.keep
!/snapple-backend/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/snapple-backend/storage/*
!/snapple-backend/storage/.keep

/snapple-backend/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/snapple-backend/config/master.key
